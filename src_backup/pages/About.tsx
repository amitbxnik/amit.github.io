              I'm a third-year CSE student at UConn with experience in software
              and web development, information security, machine learning, and
              computational biology. While I have a strong interest in computing
              and biology/health, I'm eager to apply my skills broadly across
              computer science.

              Outside of academics, I love learning new languages (currently
              Spanish), staying active through basketball, soccer, and swimming,
              and relaxing by playing chess or the saxophone.
